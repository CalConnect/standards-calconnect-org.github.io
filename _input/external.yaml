    abstract: The Recurrence Technical Committee of The Calendaring and Scheduling
      Consortium has collected specific information on how Calendaring and Scheduling
      implementations have, or have not, implemented the Recurrence Rules of RFCs
      2445 and 2446, iCalendar and iTIP. This document is part of the committee's
      work to compile actual usage information and interoperability issues. The Recurrence
      Committee recently collected information in the form of a Recurrence Questionnaire,
      which allowed vendors and other producers and consumers of iCalendar recurrences
      to list the features of iCalendar that they implemented. The questionnaire also
      contained space for comments about each line item in the RFCs and also overall
      issues with recurrences. The Recurrence Technical Committee has since analyzed
      the results of the questionnaire into this document.

    revdate: 2005-09-26
    abstract: This document is one in a series of use case documents that the Calendaring
      and Scheduling Consortium is developing to help better define the needs of different
      calendaring and scheduling user groups. As such, this document provides a list
      of use cases for a calendar access protocol only. Other use case documents will
      cover different areas of calendaring and scheduling, and will be made available
      by the Consortium in the usual manner. While this list of use cases was developed
      to assist in the development of the CalDAV protocol, none of the use cases are
      specific to CalDAV, that is, this list of use cases should apply to any calendar
      access protocol. It is expected that this document will be used as a basis to
      further develop technical requirements for a calendar access protocol such as
      CalDAV.

      of questionnaires that the Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium has conducted
      to help better understand the requirements, problems and needs for calendaring
      and scheduling solutions. It is expected that the results of these questionnaires
      will be used to help define requirements and recommendations for calendaring
      and scheduling products. This particular document summarizes the results of
      the Timezone Technical Committee's questionnaire on Timezone support in iCalendar
      products. Other questionnaire summary documents will cover different areas of
      calendaring and scheduling, and will be made available by the Consortium.

      to aid in the development of recommendations on how to address any problem areas.
      A number of responses were received to the online questionnaire, and a summary
      and brief conclusion of these results is presented, along with the raw results
      themselves. Respondents to the questionnaire answered based on the capabilities
      of their device. The results show an aggregate of these results.

      application domain. Minimum interoperability is the basic level of functionality
      our collective experience tells us is necessary to have a useful system. The
      thrust of this effort is to enable resource inter-operability such that, when
      a described event contains resources, the recipient of that event is able to
      make practical use of the described resources; ideally the recipient should
      be so enabled regardless of whether the recipient is within the same calendaring
      domain. The resulting recommendations rely in part upon adoption of standards
      revisions that are in draft as of this writing.
