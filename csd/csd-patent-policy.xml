in collaborative technologies with a focus on interoperability
across the globe and communities of practice.</p>
<p id="_2768875b-b099-4968-bb91-acd75a9cd2cb">As a proponent of open standards, CalConnect does not endorse

<clause id="_purpose" obligation="informative"><title>Purpose</title><p id="_536f59c2-cf1d-4836-b4c8-219a0949ef2c">This document describes the policy of CalConnect with regards to patent
usage within CalConnect deliverables and provides a
"code of practice" that is simple and straightforward.</p>
<p id="_828a546a-8fc6-434b-a1bd-449addaa5bd4">CalConnect deliverables are drawn up by technical, not patent, experts,
who may not be fully aware of all nuisances in the complex
international legal situation of intellectual property rights.</p>
<p id="_c0b70fdd-3835-4e9c-97e1-bbe75d69ec83">CalConnect deliverables are non-binding — their objective is to ensure
compatibility of technologies and systems on a worldwide basis.</p>
<p id="_34c996dc-9a62-468e-80a4-c583d8da8935">To ensure the applicability and accessibility of CalConnect
deliverables, the implementation and continued usage of content within
the deliverables must be possible to the worldwide audience without
discrimination, including any patent embodiment in such deliverables.</p></clause></introduction></preface><sections>
